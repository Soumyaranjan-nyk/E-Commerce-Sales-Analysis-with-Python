# E-Commerce-Sales-Analysis-with-Python
Project Summary: 
This project analyzes e-commerce sales data to uncover trends, evaluate business performance, and provide actionable recommendations for maximizing revenue and profitability. Using Python, the analysis was structured into key steps: Data Gathering, Data Preparation, Visualization, Insights Derivation, and Strategic Recommendations.


Key Objectives:
Determine monthly sales trends and identify peak and low-performing months.
Assess category and sub-category performance in terms of sales and profit.
Evaluate customer segment contributions to sales and profitability.
Analyze the sales-to-profit ratio for business efficiency.


Highlights of Analysis:

Sales Trends: December consistently records the highest sales, with year-end campaigns driving profitability. Mid-year performance (June-July) shows a decline, suggesting seasonal fluctuations.

Category Insights:
Technology is the leading sales contributor (36.4%), followed by Furniture (32.3%) and Office Supplies.
Despite high sales, Furniture's profit contribution is minimal, requiring targeted improvements.

Sub-Category Analysis:
Top-performing sub-categories: Copiers, Phones, and Chairs.

Loss-making sub-categories: Tables and Bookcases, with Tables showing the most significant loss.

Customer Segments: The Consumer segment dominates sales and profit contributions, while the Home Office segment significantly underperforms, presenting opportunities for growth.


Key Recommendations:

Invest in Profitable Sub-Categories: Scale up efforts for high-margin products like Copiers, Phones, and Chairs through promotional campaigns and stock adjustments.

Address Loss-Making Areas: Reevaluate the pricing and demand for Tables and Bookcases. Introduce bundles or discontinue low-demand lines.

Seasonal Campaigns: Leverage year-end peaks (December) and mid-year spikes (February, April) with targeted marketing efforts to sustain high sales.

Boost the Home Office Segment: Tailor campaigns such as discounts and personalized bundles to attract this underperforming customer base.

Inventory Optimization: Ensure high-demand products are well-stocked during peak periods to avoid supply shortages.



This project provides a comprehensive understanding of e-commerce sales dynamics, enabling data-driven decisions for sustained growth.
